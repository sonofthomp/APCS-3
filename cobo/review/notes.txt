1a) public static double sentimentVal( String word )
1b) The method requires a String param. 
    Incompatible types error if param is not a String.
1c) The method returns a double.

2) 
    abandoned : -0.09
    ability : -0.03
    account : 0.64
    Pog : 0.0

3a) Would compile. Param is compatible and varType is compatible w/ obj type.
3b) Would not compile. Param not compatible and varType not compatible w/ obj type.
3c) Would not compile. There are 2 params instead of 1.

4) totalSentiment() iterates through a string until there are no more spaces left.
   Each iteration, the sentiment of the first word is added to total sentiment and then that word is removed from the string.

5a) The ratings make sense. Reviews with more possitive words have higher ratings.
5b) Maybe add points for punctuation or captials.

6a) The student wrote his code so that any sentiment < 15 will return a 4 as that is the first boolean statement checked.
    He also made it so that anything > 15 returns a 0, which I assume isn't supposed to happen.
6b) He can fix this by fliping the conditionals around. Starting from if (totalSentiment < 0) down to if (totalSentiment < 15)
