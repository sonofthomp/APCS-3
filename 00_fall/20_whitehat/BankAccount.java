DISCO
- You can only access private variables and methods within the class they are created in.
  - One way around this issue is to create public methods that call upon the private variables/methods

QCC
  ON TARGET TRIO CODE: 
  - toString() or method to print/return account info is needed.

  - We aren't able to check account info because there is no toString() or print/return info method that we can run to avoid calling the instance variables directly. Instance vars are private so we can't access them in this class.

  - Authenticate method only tests to see whether the values inputted match the instance of BankAccount named myCopyDuck instead of the account information provided for each individual instance. People wouldn't be able to authenticate themselves if they don't know the info of myCopyDuck and if they DO know the info of myCopyDuck, they can authenticate themselves into any instance and mess stuff up.

  - The return type for WithdrawMoney() should be boolean and not void.

  - Suggestive edit: There should also be a mutator for each individual variable instead of setting all the variables in one method. This makes it so that you don't have to set each inst var everytime you want to change a specific var.

DISCO:
|| is used in boolean statements to represent the word "or"
e.g. if(x||y){//do stuff} means that the conditional will only happen if x is true or y is true.
if we try to compare the parameters of authenticate() to the values in myDuck in the authenticate() method, then we get a static error because myDuck is not defined in the authenticate() method
a solution to this is for authenticate(), we can create a copy of myDuck called myCopyDuck, and test myCopyDuck against the parameters of authenticate()
QCC:
our withdraw method and the one in the library repo are void (meaning that it doesn't return anything), so how can we return True or False if the method doesn't have a boolean return type?
