Compile-time errors:

  Check for common syntax errors like forgetting a semicolon or braces.
  Make backups of the program you are working on.
  Remove sections of code to check if program will compile properly.
    If it does, then the error is in deleted code.
    If it doesn't then error is in remaining code.
  Don't always listen to what the compiler tells you to do.



Run-time errors:

  Use print statements as a way to trace a method or loop.
  Use temporary variables to avoid complex expressions.
  Check recursive function if StackOverflowError
  Check the lines in which exceptions occur.
  Remove print statements that don't help or combine print statements.
  Scale down the program.
  Clean up code.



Logic errors (Program doesn't work as you want it to work):

  Model the code first, and find which part of the actual code and the model differ.
  Take a break and come back to the program later if stuck.
  Ask another person to look at code or talk to duck if still stuck.
